          <h1 class="glitch">Neptune</h1>
          <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar planet. 
            In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive 
            planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more 
            massive than its near-twin Uranus.</p>

          <h1 class="glitch">Uranus</h1>
          <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek
             god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather 
             of Ares, grandfather of Zeus and father of Cronus. It has the third-largest planetary 
             radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.</p>

          <h1 class="glitch">Saturn</h1>
          <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System,
             after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times
              that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its
               larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.</p>

          <h1 class="glitch">Jupiter</h1>
          <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
            It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the 
            other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth 
            the mass of the Sun.</p>

          <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the 
            Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is 
            named for the Roman god of war.</p>

          <p>Our beautiful home-sweet-home. Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of 
            about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.</p>

          <h1 class="glitch">Venus</h1>
          <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it the closest to Earth. 
            It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as 
            large and has a similar composition.</p>

          <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
             Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.</p>

          <h1 class="glitch">The Sun</h1>
          <p>Our beloved big yellow star. The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
            It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear 
            fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet,
             and infrared radiation, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth</p>
